# Lantana

This is a colour picker for developers who are working with a existing design language, like Material Design or Ant Design.

This app was built with Electron and Angular 2, inspired by [MaterialColorsApp](https://github.com/romannurik/MaterialColorsApp) by Brian Kelley.

# Usage

This app works on Windows from tray if the tray is on the bottom of the screen.
